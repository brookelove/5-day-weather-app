# 5-day-weather-app
## Motivation
I wanted to learn more about APIs and Bootstrap. I wanted to understandhow they function so to do that I made weather app. During this application I had to fetch data from an opensource API then put the function back into my card to work. It alowwed me to also understand bootstrap which was a task on it's own.
